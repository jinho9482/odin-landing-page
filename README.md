This is my first css project.
I made full website mainly using flexbox.
See the following process to make the website that I worked on.

Overall

1. Put "boilerplate code". 
2. Split "body" to 3 sections, "header" "main" "footer".
3. Add styles using css section by section.

What I learn

1. Remove padding and margin of whole document not to get interrupted by innate those properties of elements.
2. Set flexbox for centering contents and add the width to their items for limiting size of contents.
   If I set the width for the first flex container and center it, the contents center in the box with specific width not whole line.
3. Add "margin as auto" of the flex item to the "one" element which is going to be separated not a bunch of contents.
4. Add "list-style-type" property for deleting dots on "unordered lists".
5. Add "border-radius" property to curve the border.
6. Add "text-decoration" property to remove underline of hyperlink.
7. Set the height of flex container for controlling that of image still keeping aspect ratio at the same time.
8. Be careful using some properties that are not inherited to their child.
9. Add "overflow-wrap: break-word" to confine texts inside the specific width.
